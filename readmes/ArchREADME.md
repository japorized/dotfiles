# Arch Linux README
### This document keeps a record of the setup that I have with Arch

This is currently important since I am running Arch on a VM, i.e. it may
get removed any time whenever I need space on my current computer.
This README will keep track of the packages that I have currently installed,
as well as my setup for everything else.
